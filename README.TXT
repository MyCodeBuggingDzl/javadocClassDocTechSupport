TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.


Questions of part 3

43. the putIfAbsent method writes down the value if it doesn't have a key.

46. Accurate: The Classes and methods shows their description, parameters 
    and the return values.
    Completeness: Yes, it's complete, all are listed.
    Useful parts: It explains clearly the purpose & it's easy to see the methods parameters.
    Less useful parts: It doesn't tells you the error, you have to test it yourself to fix it.
    Errors: Some of the description are very unclear.
    
47. It gives us info about the classes and methods.

48. I found another JavaDoc key symbols, @since, it indicates the version of the class and method
    when they were introduce. I found out about the JavaDoc key symbol are there to provide information
    about the class, methods and fields for us to understand & to make it clear.

    49. Add a few java keys and comments
